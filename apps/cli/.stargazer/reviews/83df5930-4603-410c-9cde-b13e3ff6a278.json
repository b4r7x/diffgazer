    "summary": "This extensive diff introduces significant architectural and user experience improvements, focusing on enhanced user control, transparency, and extensibility. Key changes include a new project trust system, a wizard-style onboarding and settings management, a real-time streaming review process with agent activity, and a highly interactive split-screen review UI. The data models for AI issues have been greatly enriched, and the system's robustness against malformed AI responses has been improved through strict prompt engineering and robust JSON parsing. Overall, this is a very positive and impactful set of changes.",

        "description": "The `PROVIDER_ENV_VARS` constant is defined in both `apps/cli/src/app/screens/onboarding-screen.tsx` and `apps/cli/src/app/screens/settings-screen.tsx`. Similarly, `AGENT_EVENT_TYPES` is duplicated in `apps/cli/src/features/review/api/triage-api.ts` and `apps/cli/src/features/review/hooks/use-triage.ts`. These should ideally be moved to a shared utility or constants file within `@repo/core` or a common CLI module to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency.",

        "title": "Deprecated Hook Documentation",
        "description": "The `useConfig` hook now contains a JSDoc `@deprecated` tag suggesting to use `useSettingsState` from `features/settings`. While the tag is present, it might be beneficial to update the documentation or provide a clearer migration path if this hook is intended to be fully replaced, especially since `useConfig` still exposes many critical functionalities (like `saveConfig`, `deleteConfig`, `deleteProviderCredentials`) that `useSettingsState` might not fully encapsulate or expose directly in the same way.",
        "suggestion": "Clarify the deprecation strategy for `useConfig`. If `useSettingsState` is a full replacement, ensure all necessary functionalities are exposed there. Otherwise, detail which parts of `useConfig` remain relevant or how they integrate with `useSettingsState`."
