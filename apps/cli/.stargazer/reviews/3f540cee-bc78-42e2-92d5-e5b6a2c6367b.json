    "summary": "This massive diff represents a significant and highly positive architectural and user experience overhaul. The changes introduce a robust, interactive CLI with real-time AI agent feedback, a structured settings/onboarding system, and enhanced data quality for AI review results. The shift to a parallel, event-streamed AI review process is a major step forward for performance and observability. Documentation has been extensively updated to reflect these changes. While the complexity of some components has increased, it is largely justified by the added functionality and user value.",

        "title": "Truncation in Loading Display",
        "description": "The `LoadingDisplay` truncates the `content` prop to 200 characters using `truncate(content, 200)`. While useful for display, if the AI's initial verbose output is critical context during loading, truncating it might obscure important information from the user.",
        "suggestion": "Consider if truncating is always appropriate here, or if there could be an option to view full content, perhaps on interaction, or if a different summary of the loading progress would be more informative than raw truncated content."

        "title": "Clarify `useConfig` deprecation",
        "description": "The comment `@deprecated Use useSettingsState from features/settings instead` is a good signal, but `useConfig` still handles core AI provider configuration (saving/deleting provider credentials). If `useSettingsState` does not fully absorb these responsibilities, the deprecation message might be misleading or the migration path unclear. It would be beneficial to explicitly state which parts are being replaced and which, if any, remain unique to `useConfig`.",
        "suggestion": "Refine the deprecation comment to clearly delineate the responsibilities that `useSettingsState` takes over from `useConfig` and, if applicable, any remaining functions unique to `useConfig`."

        "title": "ReviewView `handleBack` behavior",
        "description": "The `handleBack` function in `ReviewView` calls `exit()` directly. While this might be the intended behavior for the interactive review application, it means the user cannot return to the `main` menu or `review-history` view after exiting a review, forcing a full application restart to re-enter the main flow. This could be a jarring experience if the user expects to navigate back through the app's history.",
        "suggestion": "Consider if `handleBack` should navigate to a previous view (e.g., `setView('main')`) instead of exiting the entire application, especially if the user entered the review from the main menu or review history. This would provide a more consistent navigation experience."
