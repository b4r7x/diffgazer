# About Stargazer

I just wanted to have my own code reviewer. Most of what I'm writing here is roast on myself, because of being guilty of being lazy.

Claude Codex, Codex - great tools for writing code, but when it comes to code review, I'd like not to burn my tokens that could go towards development for that. Yes, that's my part of responsibility to do a review myself, but I'm just a human, I can miss things. So instead of spending tokens from these tools to review the code (that's mostly written by them lol), I wanted to create a alternative with a free providers, and yes... it comes with a cost of your privacy, that's why I really want to warn you to be with what you are giving it to review. Yes, it skips env files and secrets or any sensitive information by default, but please be causion what you are put there anyway.

While builiding this project it really confirmed one's belief in the part, where I miss a lot of things while developing... and sometimes you want to skip those reviews and go with the "vibe"... that's the worst possible thing you can do in the age of AI, and me, myself, I'm not immune to that. It's more important than it's ever been, we are generating code faster than we can understand it. Even without AI humans write bugs, we always have, and sometimes it's pain to go through changes you've made and focus to find out all the things that are wrong with it, so I wanted to help myself, and others with that.

## My problem

Most solo developers don't get their code reviewed. Ever. 

Sometimes they care about privacy of their code, doesn't want to share it with strangers to get a review done, sometimes it's a fear of being judged by others. But the need to review is there, you want to find out what stupid mistakes you could possibly make. To improve in the future, to not follow the same mistakes again. Sometimes it the edge case you've missed, sometimes it's the security hole that you might not even thought about.

That's how I wanted to solve for myself especially. 

## Why did I use Gemini as default

This project started as a entry to Gemini hackathon, so Gemini became the default provider. But it stayed the default because it genuinely works well for this use case.

I really don't like Geminit for coding, it's not there yet for me, but for the review it does pretty solid work. I've been using Gemini Flash for that usecase - cheap, fast and to my surprise, pretty accurate.

Some specifics from real usage:

- **Free tier is enough for me** - quota allowed me to do 2-3 full reviews on large PRs wihin a single limit cycle, without any optimizations for it (which I plan to do)
- **Speed** - the output was quicker than the providers I tested (GLM Coding Plan, OpenRouter free models)
- **Parallel agents** - which didn't work correctly with other providers, I tent to get errors while trying to do this with GLM Coding Plan to my surprise, but it works fine with Gemini Flash (probably skill issue within my implementation lol)
- **Quality-to-cost ratio** - as mentioned, faster than GLM, but similar output quality (or even better)

I still support Z.AI and OpenRouter because provider lock-in is bad and I don't want to be vendor-locked, but for this usecase, I'd recommend give Gemini Flash a try.

## About the vibes...

Yes, I'll be honest, most of the code in this repo was generated by Claude and Codex during the hackathon. With the goal of shipping a working MVP, I don't really like it, I can't say with confidence that I reviewed each line of the code (which my own tool was also helping during the development), but I'm really willing to drop this approach, because it didn't feel right to me.

It proved the tool's point to myself. Reviewing the code that was AI generated showed me how the engineering with AI generated code is way behind in the develooment cycle, quality drops, and I hate it myself, that I came to a point where I want to drop this approach, because it might feel rapid, but the quality for me wasn't there. Ironic.

I came to a point where I want quality over quantity. Know your code. Know your quality.

Of course there is a practical side of this, because the hackathon pace couldn't be sustained. Moving fast feels productive until it stops feeling like anything at all. I want to enjoy the work again, ship less, preserving my programming skills, learning new things, avoiding burnout - these things matter more than velocity.

**Know your code. No need to race.**

## So what's comming to stargazer

Until April 2026, I'll be taking a little of the break. To focus on bug fixes, quality improvements, maybe small features, but not on the breaking changes. The priority is stability.

Starting April 2026, development would get more deliberate (I hope I still have a strength for that lol). I did a small roadmap with phased priorites: 
- Local provider support (Olama, LM Studio)
- Improvements to the UI and UX
- more provider integration
- Github Actions workflows
- eventually a headless CLI mode

The pace will be intentionally slower, I don't want this to be another vibecoded slop that ships fast and breaks faster. I want to be proud of it and want to deliver something that will be useful also for you.

See the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for the full list.
