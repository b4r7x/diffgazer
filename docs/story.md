# Why I Built Stargazer

I wanted my own code reviewer.

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor — great tools for writing code. But every review cycle burns tokens that could go toward building. I kept thinking: why am I spending money to have AI look at code when I could spend it to ship features?

Then I looked at it differently. Code review in the age of AI isn't optional — it's more important than it's ever been. We're generating code faster than we can understand it. Vibe coding is real, and the output needs a second pair of eyes. Even without AI, humans write bugs. We always have. The point of review is catching them early, before they compound.

## The solo dev problem

Most solo developers don't get their code reviewed. Ever.

Sometimes it's privacy — you don't want to share your codebase with strangers or third parties. Sometimes it's fear of being judged. Sometimes there's just nobody available to ask. But the need is there. You want to know if your code has security holes. You want someone to catch an edge case you missed. You want to hear "this is over-engineered" before you ship it.

Stargazer is how I solve that for myself. A local tool that reviews my code, keeps everything on my machine, and only sends the diff to an AI provider I choose.

## Why Gemini

This project started during a Gemini hackathon, so Gemini became the default provider. But it stayed the default because it genuinely works well for this use case.

I'll be honest — I don't love Gemini for writing code with AI. But for review? Different story entirely. Gemini Flash is fast, cheap, and surprisingly accurate. The benchmarks are solid, but more importantly, my own experience during months of development confirmed it.

Some specifics from real usage:

- **Free tier was enough** — the quota allowed 2-3 full reviews on large PRs within a single limit cycle. That's usable.
- **Speed** — noticeably faster than GLM (Z.AI Coding Plan) and most models through OpenRouter.
- **Parallel agents** — Gemini handled concurrent multi-agent requests reliably. Other providers choked on this, which is why I added a sequential execution mode as a fallback.
- **Quality-to-cost ratio** — best I found across everything I tested.

I still support Z.AI and OpenRouter because provider lock-in is bad and people have preferences. But if you're asking me what to use, start with Gemini.

## On AI-generated code

Let me be upfront about something. Most of the code in this repo was generated by Claude and Codex during the hackathon. The goal was shipping a working MVP, and it worked.

But it also proved the tool's own point. Reviewing AI-generated code during development showed me exactly where quality dropped — especially in the frontend, where I spent the least time doing review. I assumed generated UI code wouldn't carry serious issues. That assumption was wrong. The experience reinforced my conviction that continuous code review is one of the most important parts of building software. Ironically, building a review tool taught me that by making me skip reviews under time pressure.

Going forward, the approach changes completely. Quality over quantity. Less AI-generated code, more actually understanding what's in the codebase. Not because AI code is inherently bad — but because I want to know my code. I want to learn from the process, not just ship output.

There's also a practical side to this. The hackathon pace was not sustainable. Moving fast feels productive until it stops feeling like anything at all. I'd rather ship less and keep enjoying the work. Preserving programming skills, learning new things, avoiding burnout — these matter more than velocity.

**Know your code. No need to race.**

## What's next

Until April 2026, Stargazer stays roughly where it is. Bug fixes, quality improvements, maybe small features — but no breaking changes. The priority is stabilizing what's already here.

Starting April 2026, development gets more deliberate. I'm planning a proper roadmap with phased priorities: local provider support (Ollama, LM Studio), better UI, more provider integrations, GitHub Actions workflows, and eventually a headless CLI mode.

The pace will be intentionally slower. I don't want this to be another vibecodeded project that ships fast and breaks faster. I want it to be a tool I'm proud of and that actually helps people review their code.
